<h1>Emily Morton-Owens</h1>
<p>I'm the Assistant University Librarian for Digital Library Development & Systems at the University of Pennsylvania (currently Acting Associate UL for Library Technology Services). I also teach in Drexel's College of Computing & Informatics. My interests include information architecture, extraction, and retrieval; discovery systems and integrated library systems; digital preservation; content strategy; and more.</p>

<p>Previously I've worked in a public library, an academic medical library, a botany library, and a business library; and before library school in several small suburban public libraries, a bustling undergraduate library, and a university archive. I received my MSLIS from Drexel (2007) and a Master's in Computer Science from NYU (2012, thesis). My BA is from Yale (German Studies with a concentration in History of Art).</p>

<p>My personal interests include classical music, foreign languages (especially German, French, and Dutch), playing the piano, urbanism, and (of course) reading. You can usually find me on Twitter and Goodreads.</p>
